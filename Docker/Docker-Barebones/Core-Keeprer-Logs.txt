This error indicates a protocol mismatch between your Core Keeper game client and the dedicated server. Specifically:

RpcSystem received bad protocol version: This occurs when the RPC (Remote Procedure Call) systems between the client and server differ due to updates in game code or data definitions.

Local protocol vs. Remote protocol mismatch: The server is using one version of the game's networking protocol, and the client is using another. This typically happens when the server's version doesn’t match the game client.

Steps to Fix the Issue
1. Check Game Client Version
Confirm the game client on your computer is the latest version available on Steam.
If it's outdated, update it via Steam.
2. Update the Server Image
The server is likely running an older version of Core Keeper. Update it to match the client:

bash
Copy code
docker pull escaping/core-keeper-dedicated:latest
Then restart the server with the updated image:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
3. Ensure Data Compatibility
After updating the server, check if your saved data is compatible:

Review the server logs:
bash
Copy code
docker logs core-keeper-dedicated
Ensure it loads your saved world without errors.
4. If the Issue Persists
Verify there are no leftover files from older versions in your volume directories:
/home/agt/docker/core-keeper/server-files
/home/agt/docker/core-keeper/server-data
If unsure, temporarily rename these directories and let the server recreate fresh ones:

bash
Copy code
mv /home/agt/docker/core-keeper/server-files /home/agt/docker/core-keeper/server-files-old
mv /home/agt/docker/core-keeper/server-data /home/agt/docker/core-keeper/server-data-old
Then restart the server and see if it connects. If it works, carefully copy your world save files from the backup into the new directories.

5. Cross-Check SteamCMD Cache
If using SteamCMD in the Docker image to update the server, verify the cache is cleared:

Access the container:
bash
Copy code
docker exec -it core-keeper-dedicated bash
Update the server manually within the container:
bash
Copy code
steamcmd +login anonymous +force_install_dir /home/steam/core-keeper-dedicated +app_update 1963720 validate +quit
Then restart the container.

6. Check for Beta or Experimental Builds
If your game client is on a beta branch (e.g., experimental updates), the server must match that build. Set the appropriate environment variable in override.env or add it directly to docker-compose.yml:

yaml
Copy code
environment:
  - BETA_BRANCH=experimental
Restart the server to apply.

Test again after these steps and let me know if you encounter further issues!

The error bash: steamcmd: command not found suggests that the steamcmd binary is either not properly installed or not in the container's PATH. Since you see a steamcmd directory when listing files, it's likely SteamCMD exists but hasn't been set up correctly for execution.

Fix SteamCMD Command Not Found
1. Locate SteamCMD
Run the following to confirm where the steamcmd executable is located:

bash
Copy code
find /home/steam/ -name steamcmd
It’s likely in /home/steam/steamcmd/steamcmd.sh.

2. Run SteamCMD Directly
If found, run SteamCMD using its full path. For example:

bash
Copy code
/home/steam/steamcmd/steamcmd.sh +login anonymous +force_install_dir /home/steam/core-keeper-dedicated +app_update 1963720 validate +quit
3. Add SteamCMD to PATH
If you want to make steamcmd globally executable within the container:

bash
Copy code
export PATH=$PATH:/home/steam/steamcmd
You can then call steamcmd directly:

bash
Copy code
steamcmd.sh +login anonymous +force_install_dir /home/steam/core-keeper-dedicated +app_update 1963720 validate +quit
4. Ensure SteamCMD is Installed
If the above doesn’t work, SteamCMD might not be properly installed. Reinstall it in the container:

bash
Copy code
cd /home/steam/
wget https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/client/installer/steamcmd_linux.tar.gz
tar -xvzf steamcmd_linux.tar.gz
Then rerun the update command.

5. Restart the Container
After updating, exit the container and restart it to apply the changes:

bash
Copy code
docker restart core-keeper-dedicated
Let me know if you encounter further issues!

The error ERROR! Failed to install app '1963720' (Missing file permissions) indicates that the directory where you're trying to install the Core Keeper server files doesn't have the correct permissions.

Steps to Resolve
1. Check Directory Permissions
Verify the permissions of /home/steam/core-keeper-dedicated:

bash
Copy code
ls -ld /home/steam/core-keeper-dedicated
If the directory doesn't exist or isn't writable by the current user, create it and assign proper permissions:

bash
Copy code
mkdir -p /home/steam/core-keeper-dedicated
chown -R steam:steam /home/steam/core-keeper-dedicated
chmod -R 755 /home/steam/core-keeper-dedicated
2. Run the SteamCMD Command Again
After fixing permissions, rerun the command:

bash
Copy code
/home/steam/steamcmd/steamcmd.sh +force_install_dir /home/steam/core-keeper-dedicated +login anonymous +app_update 1963720 validate +quit
3. Check for Root-Specific Issues
If you're running the container as root, ensure the directories are accessible to root. Alternatively, create a non-root user like steam (if not already done) to ensure the server runs securely:

bash
Copy code
adduser steam
su - steam
# Then run SteamCMD as the 'steam' user
/home/steam/steamcmd/steamcmd.sh +force_install_dir /home/steam/core-keeper-dedicated +login anonymous +app_update 1963720 validate +quit
4. Validate SteamCMD Installation
Ensure the SteamCMD directory itself has proper permissions:

bash
Copy code
chown -R steam:steam /home/steam/steamcmd
chmod -R 755 /home/steam/steamcmd
5. Verify Disk Space
Confirm that the container has enough available disk space for the installation:

bash
Copy code
df -h
6. Reattempt Installation
Retry the installation with SteamCMD after these adjustments.

Let me know if this resolves the issue!

Great! The installation succeeded with the message: Success! App '1963720' fully installed. 🎉

Yes, you should restart the Docker Compose setup to apply the changes and ensure the Core Keeper dedicated server starts with the updated files. Here's what you need to do:

Restart Docker Compose
Navigate to your Docker Compose directory (where the docker-compose.yml file is located).
Restart the services:
bash
Copy code
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
This will stop the current containers and restart them with the updated configuration.
Verify the Server
After restarting, confirm the server is running correctly:

Check the logs:

bash
Copy code
docker logs <container_name>
Replace <container_name> with the name of your Core Keeper container.

Ensure the server is accessible (e.g., through your game client or port checks).

If the server doesn't behave as expected or you encounter issues, let me know the container logs or error messages so I can assist further!
